% Function to align all bursts from a single recording to their peak.
% Function with 2 arguments:
% 1) burst_profiles -> the spike times histograms of all the burst detected
% in that recording and stored row-wise in an array
% Can be called with one output argument:
% alignedBursts = burstalign(burst_profiles, show)
% In this case the output will be the array with all the bursts profiles
% aligned to their peak and the relative plots
% Or two:
% [alignedBursts, mean_burst] = burstalign(burst_profiles, show)
% In this case the output will be the array with all the bursts profiles
% aligned to their peak and an array with the average burst calculated as point-bypoint average
% of all the bursts aligned at their peak. Their relative plot will show
% the average one in red
